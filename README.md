# Social-media-engagement-analysis
This project focuses on analyzing social media engagement data to gain insights into audience behavior, content performance, and trends. By performing this analysis, we aim to optimize our social media strategy and improve engagement with our target audience.


Some additional info about the platform:

*The platform focuses on user anonymity by tracking user interactions on each piece of content instead of the user profiles themselves.

*They also provide users with over 100 different types of ‘reactions’ (or interactions) to engage with each piece of content.

*Each of the ‘reactions’ has a ranking score attached to it. The higher the score, the better.
